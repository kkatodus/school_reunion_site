# About this project

This project is a private social media for a my gradeschool reunion which was planned in 2020. But due to the covid-19 situation, the actual event had to be cancelled.

## What did I use
This project is using django as a backend and the html, css, and js files are also being hosted by the django server. It uses the django templating engine to dynamically render the UI.
